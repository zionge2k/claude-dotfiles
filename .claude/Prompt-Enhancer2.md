## 🎯 Enhancement Patterns by Transformation Rules

### Vague → Specific

```markdown
[Input] "Fix this code" [Analysis]

- Unclear which file
- Ambiguous what to fix
- No defined goals

[Output] "Optimize performance for src/components/UserList.tsx:

- Current issue: 3-second delay when rendering 1000 items
- Target: Reduce render time to under 1 second
- Methods: Apply React.memo, virtualization, or pagination
- Preserve existing styling and API interface"
```

### Simple → Detailed Plan

```markdown
[Input] "Add search feature" [Analysis]

- Unclear where to add
- Ambiguous search targets and methods
- Missing UI/UX considerations

[Output] "Implement real-time search for ProductList component:

1. UI Implementation:

   - Create new SearchBar.tsx component
   - Follow UserList.tsx styling for consistency

2. Search Logic:

   - Filter by name, category, and tags
   - Apply 300ms debouncing
   - Highlight search results

3. State Management:

   - Use useState for search terms and results
   - Optimize API calls with useEffect

4. Testing:
   - Unit tests for search component
   - Performance testing with 1000 items"
```

### Feature Request → Complete Workflow

```markdown
[Input] "Create login functionality" [Analysis]

- Authentication method unclear
- Security considerations missing
- Integration with existing system needed

[Output] "Build comprehensive user authentication system:

Phase 1 - Backend Authentication:

- models/User.js: bcrypt password hashing
- middleware/auth.js: JWT token validation
- routes/auth.js: login/signup endpoints
- Follow existing API router patterns

Phase 2 - Frontend Implementation:

- components/LoginForm.tsx: form validation and error handling
- hooks/useAuth.js: authentication state management
- utils/authService.js: API call logic
- Reference existing UserProfile.tsx styling

Phase 3 - Security Hardening:

- Implement CSRF protection
- Add login attempt limiting
- Configure security headers

Phase 4 - Testing:

- Unit tests: per component
- Integration tests: complete auth flow
- Security tests: vulnerability verification"
```

## 📂 Project Context Utilization Strategies

### Existing Pattern Analysis

```markdown
[Code Style Extraction]

- Import ordering and grouping rules
- Function naming conventions
- Error handling patterns
- State management approaches
- Testing style guidelines

[Application Method] "Following existing UserService.js patterns:

- Apply same error handling approach
- Use identical logging structure
- Maintain similar test coverage"
```

### Dependency Considerations

```markdown
[package.json Analysis]

- Libraries currently in use
- Version compatibility
- Dev/production dependency separation

[Enhancement Application] "Leverage existing project libraries:

- Use existing fetch wrapper instead of axios
- Actively utilize lodash methods
- Minimize additional dependency introduction"
```

### Architecture Consistency

```markdown
[Structure Analysis]

- Folder structure and naming conventions
- Component hierarchy
- Data flow patterns

[Improvement Application] "Align with src/features/ structure:

- Create features/auth/ directory
- Maintain components/, hooks/, services/ sub-structure
- Unify exports through index.js"
```

## 🔧 Special Situation Enhancements

### Legacy Code Improvement

```markdown
[Input] "Update this old code" [Context Analysis]

- Existing code vintage and patterns
- Gap with current project standards
- Compatibility maintenance needs

[Enhanced Output] "Migrate legacy/userManager.js to modern JavaScript:

1. Syntax Updates:

   - Convert var → const/let
   - Transform functions → arrow functions (where appropriate)
   - Apply Promise → async/await conversion

2. Feature Improvements:

   - Enhance error handling (add try-catch)
   - Improve type safety (JSDoc or TS)
   - Utilize current project utilities

3. Compatibility Assurance:
   - Maintain existing API interfaces
   - Minimize impact on dependent modules
   - Design for gradual migration"
```

### Emergency Bug Fixes

```markdown
[Input] "Fix this error urgently" [Urgency Recognition + Safety Consideration]

[Enhanced Output] "Emergency bug fix (safe hotfix approach):

🚨 Immediate Fix:

- Problem file: [analyzed filename]
- Resolve error with minimal changes
- Preserve existing logic as much as possible

⚡ Temporary Measures:

- Add fallback handling for error cases
- Enhance logging for monitoring
- Provide clear error messages to users

🔍 Follow-up Tasks (separate PR):

- Root cause analysis
- Add test cases
- Review architecture improvements"
```
